## Company Details

| Data Point | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Company Name** | The name of the company. |

| **Founded** | The year when the company was founded. |
| **Description** | A short description of the company and what it does. |
| **Headquarters Location** | The company's official headquarters (city, country).  Note that for fully-remote companies, this may be just a nominal location. |
| **Other Locations** | If the company has any physical offices, list them. For fully-remote companies, list instead the approximate geographical distribution of the workforce, if available. |

## People And Funding

| Data Point | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Key People** | The names of the key people associated with the company. Focus on those who champion remote work, if identifiable. |
| **VCs And Backers** | If the company has been backed by venture capital or funding and the information about the backers is in the public domain, then list their identity. Do any backers publicly support remote work initiatives? |
| **Funding History** | If details about the company's funding history are in the public domain, then provide those here. Has funding been explicitly allocated toward remote infrastructure or initiatives? |

## Market Positioning

| Data Point | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Differentiation** | Describe what distinguishes the company's products and its philosophy from others in a similar space. Is remote work part of their value proposition (e.g., providing remote collaboration tools)? |
| **Vision** | Attempt to retrieve information in which the company or its leadership describes its broad strategic vision, especially for the current calendar year. Does their vision incorporate remote work as a core component? |
| **Competitive Landscape** | Who are the company's main competitors and how do they distinguish themselves from them? How do their remote work policies compare to those competitors? |

## Careers

| Data Point | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Remote Friendly?** | Conduct a thorough analysis of the company's approach to remote work. Include explicit policies (stated remote-first or remote-optional?), observed practices (e.g., presence on remote job boards, blog posts about remote work), and any caveats. Provide concrete evidence to support your assessment (links, screenshots, etc.). |
| **Remote Work Culture Assessment** | Assess the maturity and quality of their remote work culture. (e.g. mature, developing, non-existent). Consider asynchronous communication, documentation practices, remote team-building activities, inclusivity in virtual meetings via technology, and leadership support for remote employees. |
| **Location Restrictions?** |  **Crucially:** List all location restrictions for remote employees. E.g., "Must be located in US," "Must be within +/- 3 hours of CET," "Open to EMEA," "Excludes California," etc.  If no restrictions are explicitly stated, note that, but continue to look for implicit restrictions elsewhere (e.g. time overlap needed for meetings) |
| **Salary Transparency** | Is the company transparent about salary ranges in their job postings? (Yes/No/Partial/Varies by role). This is often a good indicator of a fair and equitable hiring process *and* a mature HR function comfortable with remote pay considerations. |
| **Global Compensation Strategy?** | Determine whether the company has a defined global compensation strategy (e.g. using a consistent formula to adjust to local cost of living) or if salary is determined on a case to case basis leading to inequalities. |
| **Time Zone Expectations?** | Document explicit or implicit time zone requirements. Does the job require significant overlap with a specific time zone, limiting flexibility despite being "remote"? |
| **Careers URL** | List the company's career URL. |
| **Mission And Values** | Investigate whether the company has articulated a vision for how it defines its internal company culture. If this has not been explicitly stated, then attempt to infer it from the company's publicly facing resources. Are remote work values (trust, autonomy, clear communication) emphasized? |
| **Careers Emails** | If you have access to an email lookup tool such as hunter.io, then engage it in order to retrieve email addresses that are likely associated with the company's recruiting or human resource functions. If you identify any, provide them here. If not, you may omit this section. |
| **LinkedIn & Other Hiring Channels** | Provide additional links to further hiring channels that the company may operate, such as LinkedIn. |
| **Red Flag Screen** | Conduct a search for any significant adverse publicity or controversy that has surrounded the company, particularly with regard to its treatment of staff or contracted resources. Consider news media reports and Glassdoor as important sources. Look for *specific* complaints about remote work policies, communication issues, or unequal treatment of remote vs. in-office employees. If you do not find anything significant, then simply report no significant information found. |

## Summary

| Data Point | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Company Position** | Summarize the overall background of the company and its position in its industry. |
| **HQ And Headcount** | Where is the company's headquarters and what is its approximate headcount? Is the headcount primarily remote, or primarily based in the HQ location? |
| **Remote Friendly?** | Is the company remote friendly? Provide a short description summarizing your previous output, including any location restrictions and the overall maturity of their remote work culture. Summarize their global compensation strategy.
| **Careers URL** | Link to the company's career URL. |
| **Lead Score Rationale** | Explicitly state the rationale for the Remote Commitment Lead Score. Justify the score based on the evidence gathered in the "Careers" section. For example: "Score of 9/10: Company explicitly states a 'Remote First' policy, has multiple fully-remote job postings with transparent salary ranges, and no location restrictions. Leadership actively promotes remote work on social media."  Or, "Score of 4/10: Company claims to be 'remote-friendly,' but most job postings require working within EST time zone and lack salary information. Glassdoor reviews mention communication challenges for remote employees." |
